  "description": "Takes a list of file names and content, adds it to a Zip file and uses Salesforce Metadata API to deploy them to Salesforce. It's very important that ALL relevant files are added and have a valid syntax. Many Metadate types like Apex classes not only have a class file but also a Meta XML file. All metadata records to be deployed must be listed in a package.xml file which ALWAYS must be part of the files.",
