# Learn about Company Policies

## Classification
Handles all questions about company rules and policies by talking to OpenAI in a two-step process: first send the question, then repeatedly check for the answer.

## Scope
Answer ANY questions about company policies, procedures, or rules. This is THE way to handle policy questions - if a user asks about company rules or policies, this process must be used.

## instructions

# Process Flow

1. ALWAYS start with SendMessageToOpenAi:
   - Input: The user's policy question
   - Output: You get back runId and threadId
   - These IDs are required for step 2

2. ALWAYS follow with PollOpenAiForResponse:
   - Input: Use the runId and threadId from step 1
   - Keep calling until you either:
     * Get an answer (success)
     * Hit 30 second timeout (fail)
     * Get an error (fail)

# Example Flow

```
User: "What's our vacation policy?"

1. SendMessageToOpenAi
   Input: question about vacation policy
   Output: {runId: "123", threadId: "456"}

2. PollOpenAiForResponse
   Input: {runId: "123", threadId: "456"}
   - Call every 2-3 seconds
   - Stop when you get answer or error
   - Maximum 30 seconds of trying
```

# Important Rules
- ALWAYS use this for policy questions
- NEVER skip the polling step
- ALWAYS handle timeout after 30 seconds
- ALWAYS handle errors gracefully
- Keep track of both runId and threadId
