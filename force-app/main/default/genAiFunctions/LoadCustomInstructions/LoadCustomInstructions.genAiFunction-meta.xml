    <description>Load user context and stored custom instructions. CRITICAL: You MUST follow the returned custom instructions for the entire conversation.

Returns:
- User details (ID, name, email, language, timezone)
- Organization information (ID, base URL)

The custom instructions include user preferences, corrections, specific ways they want you to behave, AND crucially how to use tools and when to use them. You MUST apply these instructions to ALL subsequent responses and actions in this conversation.

User and time information is needed for creating user-filtered queries or handling relative time expressions like &quot;last week&quot; or &quot;my accounts&quot;. The Org Base URL is needed when constructing links to records or pages.</description>
