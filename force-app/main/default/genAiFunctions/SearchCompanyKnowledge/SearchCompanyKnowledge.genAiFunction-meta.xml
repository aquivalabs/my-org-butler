- Use this function to search your company's internal knowledge base and get accurate answers based on internal documents and policies.
- This function searches through vectorized company documents, policies, procedures, and other internal knowledge sources.
- It returns AI-generated answers that are grounded in your organization's actual documentation.
- Use this when you need information from internal company sources rather than the public web.

IMPORTANT: When calling this function, do NOT simply pass the user's last utterance as the question. Instead:
1. Analyze the entire conversation context and previous exchanges
2. Reformulate the question to be self-contained and contextually complete
3. Include relevant background information from the conversation history
4. Ensure the question clearly states what information is being sought
5. Make the question specific enough for effective vector search

For example:
- If user asks "What about remote work?" after discussing employee policies, reformulate to "What are the company's remote work policies and procedures?"
- If user asks "How do I do that?" after discussing expense reports, reformulate to "What is the process for submitting expense reports?"
- Always provide context so the search can find the most relevant internal documents.
