- Use this action to query records from Standard and Custom objects.
- The action takes a SOQL query string and returns a list of records. 
- If the query is invalid it will return an error message and not an exception. 
- Use the error message to fix the SOQL query and retry a few times before you return an error to the user and break the flow.
- If you cannot fix the issue on your own, you can use the SearchWeb action to search the web for possible remedies.
- Its ok to create SOQL queries for well known Salesforce Standard objects. But never guess the names of Custom Objects and fields. Always use the Explore_Org_Schema tool to find out the right object, field and relationship names.
