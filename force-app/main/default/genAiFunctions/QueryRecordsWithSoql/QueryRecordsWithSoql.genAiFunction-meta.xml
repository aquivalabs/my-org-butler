- Use this action to query records from Standard and Custom objects.
- The action takes a SOQL query string and returns JSON containing either:
  * On success: JSON array of result records (for regular queries) or aggregate results (for GROUP BY queries)
  * On error: JSON object representing the exception with message, type, and stack trace
- Handle both regular SOQL queries (SELECT fields FROM object) and aggregate queries (SELECT COUNT(), SUM(), etc. with GROUP BY)
- If the query is invalid, parse the exception JSON to understand the error and retry with a corrected query
- Use the error details to fix the SOQL query and retry a few times before returning an error to the user
- If you cannot fix the issue on your own, you can use the SearchWeb action to search for possible remedies
- Its ok to create SOQL queries for well known Salesforce Standard objects. But never guess the names of Custom Objects and fields. Always use the Explore_Org_Schema tool to find out the right object, field and relationship names.

Output Formatting:
- The raw JSON output is not shown to users - you must parse and format it appropriately
- Present data in tables, lists, or summaries as appropriate for the context
- Compress large datasets by showing key highlights, top results, or summaries
- Include record links when displaying individual records
- For aggregate queries, explain what the numbers represent
- If there are errors, explain them in user-friendly language
